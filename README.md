# AirBnB_clone
ALX project

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This is the first step towards building our first full web application: the AirBnB clone. 
This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integrationâ€¦


## COMMAND LINE INTERPRETER (The Console)
### Functionalities of this command interpreter
The console is a Unix shell-like command line user interface provided by the python CmdModule It prints a prompt and waits for the user for input, for our project we used (hbnb)

- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc...
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc...)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object

  
### Execution
#### Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
```

#### But also in non-interactive mode: (like the Shell project in C)

```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
```
